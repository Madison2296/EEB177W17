## Exploring the Cocoli Dataset

```{r}
cocoli_dat <- read.table("/home/eeb177-student/Desktop/eeb-177/class-assignments/classwork-21-Feb/cocoli.txt", header = TRUE)
head(cocoli_dat)
str(cocoli_dat)

View(cocoli_dat)

sizes_in_1994 <- cocoli_dat$dbh1
names(sizes_in_1994) <- cocoli_dat$tag
sizes_in_1994[1] #subset a vector
sizes_in_1994["000001"] #subset a vector by name

sizes_in_1997 <- cocoli_dat$dbh2
names(sizes_in_1997) <- cocoli_dat$tag

sizes_in_1998 <- cocoli_dat$dbh3
names(sizes_in_1998) <- cocoli_dat$tag
#find all instances of dbh = 171
sizes_in_1994 == 171

which(sizes_in_1994 == 171)
#we want to know the fate of all trees that began 1994 with dbh 171
#first, we make a list of trees that have 171 dbh in 1994:
trees_171_1994 = which(sizes_in_1994 == 171)
trees_171_1994
sizes_in_1997[trees_171_1994]

## calculate RGR between 1997-1994

yearly_RGR_1 = ((cocoli_dat$dbh2-cocoli_dat$dbh1)/cocoli_dat$dbh1)/3

#add the RGR column
cocoli_dat$rgr1 = yearly_RGR_1
```
## Plots
```{r}
# make histograms with hist(
#barplots with barplot()
#boxplots with boxplot()
#scatterplot with plot()

hist(cocoli_dat$dbh1, xlab = "DBH in 1994 (mm)", main = "Distributions of sizes in 1994", col = "purple", xlim = c(0,2000))

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cocoli_dat) + geom_histogram(aes(dbh1)) + geom_histogram(aes(dbh2), fill = "red", alpha = .2) + ggtitle("Distribution of sizes in 1994")
```
